# Python Password Generator

This is a Python script that generates a random password of a specified length. The password can include letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it in your terminal or command prompt. The script will prompt you to enter the desired length of the password by letters, numbers and special characters.

## Example

```
Enter the desired length of the letters: 2
Enter the desired length of the numbers: 2
Enter the desired length of the symbols: 3
Your password is: kd35$%#
```         

In this example, the script generated a password with 2 letters, 2 numbers, and 3 symbols. The password is "kd35$%#", it is then shuffled randomly to make it more secure.

## Note

This script uses the `random` module to generate random characters. It also uses the `string` module to get the list of letters, numbers, and symbols.
